        <p>It is with great pleasure that I introduce myself! My name is <i>Tywunda (Pronounced Tie-won-dah) Shivers</i> however, most folks call me Ty. I was born in Northern California in the city of San Francisco. While growing up in the Bay Area and after graduating high school, I attended <i>San Francisco State University</i> where I received a B.A. in Radio and Television Production. Upon completion of my studies at SFSU I moved to Southern California which is where I have lived for the last 17 years.
        </p>
        <p>Within the first year of moving to Southern California I landed a role as a <i>Master Control Operator</i> with <i>The Walt Disney Company</i> or what is better known as the Disney Channel. I worked as a MCO for approximately 6 years and thereafter was promoted to the role of <i>Technical Operations Specialist</i>, which is just a fancy way for saying <i>On-Air Supervisor</i>. My role has been rewarding, exposing me to skill sets that only experience can teach you. I like to think of myself as a firefighter because I’m constantly putting out fires where in most cases I'm “<i>hitting the ground running</i>.” Although my present role with TWDC is rewarding it also has some grey areas, where the job like most other industries predominantly require some level of IT based knowledge. This has led me to software development. 
        </p>
        <p>I am the creative type! Be it art, my love for audio production, music, video editing, gardening, or fashion, I have a knack for attention to detail. I am a bit of a perfectionist which for me is a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that I do a job well done! The curse just means I ensure the job is well done which at times comes with a price tag namely time. As a web developer I hope to employ the skills I’ve acquired over the years into coding, bring new light and perspective to my designs. Ultimately it is my desire to give back to the world what I have received from it. In doing so I hope to <i>learn code</i>, <i>live code</i>, so that I can teach others to do the same. <b>THE FUTURE IS CODE!!!</b>
